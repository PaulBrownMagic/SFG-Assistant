# SFG-Assistant
Square Foot Gardening AI Assistant

## Description
The SFG-Assistant will contain a wealth of knowledge about plants that are recommended to grow in your Square Foot Garden. This knowledge will be browseable and queryable. This project won't teach you how to do Square Foot Gardening, for that you need to consult the [Square Foot Gardening Foundation](https://squarefootgardening.org/), but if you are Square Foot Gardening or learning to program with Logtalk, it'll be useful!

Atop of the knowledge base a variety of tools will be constructed including:

- What to grow recommender
- Garden diversity scorer
- Square Foot Garden bed planner
- Planting scheduler

## Dependencies
To run this application you will need these third-party libraries:

- [frames](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/Frames)
- [frames_persistency](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/FramesPersistency)

You may also need to adapt the `settings.lgt` file to where you store your
third-party libraries.

Currently the application is backend agnostic, so should run with any of the
Prolog dialects Logtalk officially supports.
